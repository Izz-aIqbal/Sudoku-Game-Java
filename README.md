# Sudoku Game (Java)

The Sudoku Game is a simple console-based project built in Java that demonstrates the implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It allows users to play Sudoku by entering numbers into an interactive board while following the rules of Sudoku. The project helps in practicing core Java skills such as classes, methods, encapsulation, arrays, and input handling.

This project provides an engaging way to understand OOP principles while working on a fun puzzle game.

## Key Features
- Interactive Sudoku board displayed in the console  
- Input numbers by specifying row, column, and value  
- Validation of moves according to Sudoku rules:  
  - No repeated numbers in a row  
  - No repeated numbers in a column  
  - No repeated numbers in a 3x3 sub-grid  
- Prevents invalid or duplicate moves  
- Real-time board updates after each move  
- Declares success when the puzzle is fully solved

## Technologies Used
- **Java** – Core programming language  
- **OOP Concepts** – Classes, methods, encapsulation  
- **Scanner** – For user input  
- **2D Arrays** – To represent the Sudoku grid  

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Practical implementation of **Object-Oriented Programming**  
- Working with **2D arrays** in Java  
- Input validation and conditional statements  
- Real-time game loop and user interaction  
- Problem-solving through logical constraints  

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add multiple Sudoku puzzles with varying difficulty levels  
- Implement a **Sudoku solver algorithm** (backtracking)  
- Provide hints or auto-fill options for players  
- Add **file handling** to save and load game progress  
- Create a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for better user experience

This project is a great demonstration of how Java and OOP can be applied to build a classic logic-based game. It provides a foundation for extending the game into more advanced versions with GUI and intelligent solving algorithms.
